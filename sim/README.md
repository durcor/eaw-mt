# sim/ — Recompilable sim-core slice (Product 1)

This directory holds the **functional re-implementation in C++** of Empire at War's simulation
core, lifted from `StarWarsG.exe` per `openspec/engine/decomp_plan.md` Phase 3. It is **not** a
byte-matching decomp — it reproduces *behavior*, validated by **differential testing against the
live binary** (the winmm hook DLL captures ground-truth `DIFFTRACE` per-tick checksums; the lifted
code must reproduce the same per-tick sim state).

## Methodology (per decomp_plan.md §1)

- Lift in **dependency order**: tick clock → entity-update spine → locomotor integrators →
  hardpoint fire-control → the IN sim behaviors.
- Each unit is a clean, idiomatic C++ re-implementation. Original RVAs and struct offsets are kept
  in comments for traceability (`// <- FUN_14027c360 +0x14`), but the code does **not** mirror the
  decompiler's variable soup.
- Each unit ships a **host-side self-test** (`sim/tests/`) that replays a deterministic input
  stream and asserts the lifted behavior. The in-game `DIFFTRACE` stream is the end-to-end oracle;
  the host test is the fast inner loop.
- A unit is "lifted" only when its semantics are reproduced **and** its determinism-relevant
  behavior (ordering, fixed-point/float accumulation, RNG, lockstep gating) is called out explicitly.

## Build

Host validation (no game needed):
```
just sim-test            # compiles sim/ + runs sim/tests/*; all must pass
```
or directly:
```
nix develop --command g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -Isim sim/tests/tick_clock_test.cpp sim/tick_clock.cpp -o /tmp/tick_clock_test && /tmp/tick_clock_test
```

## Status

| Unit | Source RVAs | State | Determinism notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **tick clock / scheduler** | `27c360` `27c2f0` `27c330` `27c5f0` | ✅ lifted (SP); MP lockstep gate behind `IFrameSynchronizer` (Phase-4 dep) | Fixed-timestep `1000/cap` ms; MP = lockstep `MaxAhead` + per-player command-ready gate |
| **entity-update spine** | `3639d0` `2be640` `3a6b80` | ✅ lifted (skeleton + hooks) | reverse-order behavior dispatch; GOM list order; **no child recursion** (flat list); per-unit bodies are `EntityUpdateHooks` |
| **locomotor integrators** | Starship `6236b0`+`6224b0` (+helpers); SimpleSpace `626420`+`41c000` | ✅ Starship skeleton + integrator lifted; SimpleSpace dispatch skeleton + direction/straight-move lifted (Hermite mover `625990` + special-mode `6269f0` are hooks); shared model + primitives | **✅ FIRST IN-GAME ORACLE PASS**: SimpleSpace `dir=(cos(hd·DEG2RAD),sin(hd·DEG2RAD))` matches live `state+0x14/18/1c` bit-exact (182 ticks) + `disp∥dir` (150/150). Two families (Starship raw-velocity vs SimpleSpace facing+spline-magnitude). Magnitude movers still to lift |
| hardpoint fire-control | `a76b0` `387f50` `540070` `387010` (+ `396df0`/`396070`/`387400` hooks) | 🟡 fire-budget distribution + consume + per-mount dispatcher skeleton lifted (host-validated); ship scalars + target-acq (`387400`) behind `HardpointEnv` | **`total_w` cancels** → `share_i = budget_i·(capacity−base)`; the game-speed weight scale (`540070`) is irrelevant to every share. **DTFIRE in-game survey: phase-1 distribution is DORMANT in TR content** — over a 114k-tick capital battle (81,302 ship-ticks with ≥2 active mounts) the distribution branch consumed budget on **0** ship-ticks; summed weight stays sub-1e-6 (`maxtw` rounds to 0 all battle). Weapons fire via phase-2 dispatch (`387010`→`387400`); the cancellation oracle is unobservable in this mod. **`387400` target-acq is the live fire path**. **✅ its determinism-critical OPPORTUNITY-TARGET SCAN core now lifted** (`scan_opportunity_target`, host-validated; random-start circular player sweep consuming `SimRng`, with the fog-stall + score-leak + skip-self subtleties faithful) — RNG seeding already in-game-validated via DTRNG. The surrounding guard cascade + command emission stay behind `OppScanEnv`/`HardpointEnv::acquire_targets` |
| **global sim RNG** | `1ffb40` `1ffbb0` `1ffdb0` (LCG state `DAT_140a13e24`) | ✅ lifted (`SimRng`: `range_i`/`range_f`/`percent`) | **✅ IN-GAME ORACLE PASS** (DTRNG, 20000/20000 ret+state bit-exact; draw-counts 1–7 reject + a==b no-draw): LCG `s'=s·0x41c64e6d+0xbdf`, output `(s>>10)&0x7fff`. THE Phase-3/4 determinism primitive (202 callers). Draw COUNT per call (rejection loops) is lockstep-relevant. `387400`'s opportunity-scan seeds its start index here |
| sim behaviors (13 IN) | see decomp_plan census | ⬜ | per-behavior Phase-A vs Phase-B write split |
| command/event queue | `OutgoingEventQueue` + event types | ⬜ | canonical Phase-B apply order |

The tick clock stays **serial** in the parallel rewrite — the parallelism is *within* a tick, over
entities (Phase A), not across ticks. Lifting it first pins the tick that every other unit is
validated against.
