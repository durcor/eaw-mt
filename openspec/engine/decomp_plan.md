# Engine Source Decompilation Plan

**Status:** Phases 0–2 EXECUTED (2026-05-30); Phase 3 **LIFTING** — units 1 (tick clock),
2 (entity-update spine), 3 (locomotor integrators, Starship) DONE (2026-05-30, `sim/`,
host-validated via `just sim-test`). Companion to
`threading_model.md` → *Engine-Source Sim-Parallel Rewrite — Boundary Scope*, which defines
*what the rewrite needs*; this defines *how we'd obtain the source it needs*. Phase 0 (RTTI gate)
passed; Phase 1 (infra: RTTI applied, batch decompiler, call-graph attribution, diff harness) and
Phase 2 (struct recovery + full sim-tick spine) complete — see those sections + `movement_structs.md`.

---

## 0. The honest framing first

The sim-parallel rewrite is blocked on one thing: **editable engine source**. No Petroglyph/Alamo
source leak exists, so "getting the source" means **reconstructing it from the binary** — a
decompilation. The literal ask — a *full* engine source decomp — has a hard, measured size:

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Total functions | **21,744** | `logs/functions.tsv` |
| Unnamed (`FUN_*`) | 20,558 (94.5%) | same |
| Named (mostly Ghidra auto/thunks) | 1,185 | same |
| **Understood & documented by us** | **292** (1.3%) | `grep FUN_ openspec/` |
| `.text` size | 8.37 MB | `binary_metadata.md` |
| Binary | 12 MB, x86-64, MSVC, **symbol-stripped**, optimized, statically-linked Lua 5.1 + STL | same |

For calibration: the community *matching* decomps (SM64, OoT) reconstruct **~2–4 MB** binaries that
were **less optimized**, often had **symbols/debug data**, and still took **multiple contributors
several years each**. A 12 MB, symbol-stripped, modern-optimized PC binary is a strictly harder
target. **A 100%-recompilable full decomp is a person-decade-scale effort and is not the right goal.**

**The reframe that makes this tractable:** the sim-parallel rewrite does not need the renderer,
audio, Bink video, UI, or networking decompiled. It needs a **vertical slice** — the *simulation
core* plus its *struct layouts* plus its *determinism surface*. That slice is **hundreds of
functions, not 21,744**. This plan therefore delivers two products in priority order:

- **Product 1 (critical path): a recompilable sim-core slice** — enough to actually do the rewrite.
- **Product 2 (long tail, optional): full-breadth decomp** — only if a true standalone source
  replacement (not just the threading retrofit) ever becomes the goal.

We already have the assets to start Product 1: a Ghidra project, 134 analysis scripts under
`tools/ghidra_scripts/`, 292 mapped functions (including the *entire* gsvc→movement→command path the
rewrite targets), and a working in-process instrumentation/validation vehicle (the winmm hook DLL).

---

## 1. Strategy: lift-and-validate, not big-bang

We do **not** attempt a byte-matching decomp (the decomp.me model). We do a **functional
re-implementation of the sim core in C++**, validated by **differential testing against the live
binary**: same inputs → bit-identical per-tick sim state. The original binary stays the oracle
throughout; the hook DLL captures ground-truth state checksums to compare against.

This is the only model where partial progress is *useful*: each subsystem we lift can be validated
in isolation against the running game before we depend on it.

---

## 2. Phases

### Phase 0 — Recon & feasibility gate — ✅ EXECUTED 2026-05-30, GATE PASSED DECISIVELY

**Result: the binary retains full, descriptive MSVC RTTI. Feasibility for the sim-core slice is
strongly confirmed.** Measured (`tools/ghidra_scripts/Phase0RttiRecon.java` → `logs/Phase0RttiMap.tsv`):

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| RTTI TypeDescriptors (named classes) | **1,703** (1,628 game/engine-specific, not std/CRT) |
| Validated CompleteObjectLocators / vftables | 1,992 |
| Total vtable method slots | 20,346 |
| **Distinct functions named via vtables** | **5,310 = 24.4% of all 21,744** (5,300 are known entry points) |
| Descriptive `Class::Method` debug strings | present (e.g. `GamePlayUIClass::Init`, `DatabaseConversionSystemClass::Get().System_Initialize`) — a second, independent naming source |

**The sim-core / Phase-A target subsystem is fully RTTI-named** — every type the rewrite touches:
`GameObjectClass`, `GameObjectManagerClass`, `GameModeClass`/`GameModeManagerClass`, `PlayerClass`,
the entire **Locomotor** hierarchy (`LocomotorBehaviorClass` + 15 subclasses: Starship/Walk/Fighter/
Fleet/Flying/JetPack/Bike/LandBomber/SimpleSpace/Team/LandTeam…, ~97 vmethods each),
`MovementCoordinatorClass`/`Land`/`Space`, all five pathfinders (`Land/Space/DynamicLand/LandZone/
Galactic PathFinderClass`), `TheMovementClassManagerClass`, the command/event types
(`StopMovementEventClass` and the `EventFactoryClass<…>` family), and the determinism-relevant enums
(`MovementClassType`, `LocomotorStateType`, `GameObjectCategoryType`, `CellPassabilityType`).

Our hand-mapped hot-path functions (`FUN_140387400` path-follow, `FUN_1403a76b0`, `FUN_14028d400`
gsvc, etc.) are **non-virtual helpers** — not in a vtable directly, but reachable by call-graph from
the named Locomotor/Coordinator vmethods, so Phase 1's call-graph attribution names them. The 24.4%
vtable figure is a *floor*: it excludes non-virtual methods (named by class proximity), free
functions, and the `Class::Method` debug-string set.

**Gate verdict: PASSED.** RTTI alone names a quarter of the binary and 100% of the sim-core class
skeleton — far above the ~40–50% sim-reachable threshold. **Product 1 (sim-core slice) proceeds.**
Remaining Phase-0 task before Phase 1: external-corpus recon (mod SDK / community Lua-API method
names) to label the reflected-method set (boundary item #6) — lower priority now that RTTI carries
the structural load.

---

#### (Original Phase-0 plan, for reference)
Cheap, high-leverage discovery that can multiply or kill the effort. **Decision gate at the end.**

- **RTTI recovery.** MSVC binaries retain RTTI. EaW is heavily C++ (`TheGameScoringManagerClass`,
  mode classes, GOM). Run Ghidra's RTTI analyzer / a ClassInformer-style pass → recover class names,
  vtable layouts, and inheritance for potentially **hundreds** of classes at once. This is the single
  biggest naming multiplier; do it before anything manual.
- **Debug-string harvest.** The binary names functions in its own log strings ("Pump_Threads",
  "Service", etc.). Build a string→xref→function auto-namer (extend `ExportStrings` + xref scripts)
  to label every function reachable from a descriptive log/assert string.
- **External corpus.** Survey for: the EaW/FoC **mod SDK**, the Alamo engine's public method names
  (Lua-exposed game-object API is documented by the modding community), `PerceptionFunctionG.dll`
  symbols, and any debug build / PDB fragments. Community Lua API docs directly name the reflected
  C++ method set (work item #6 in the boundary scope).
- **Gate:** tally auto-recovered names + struct count. If RTTI+strings name ≳40–50% of sim-reachable
  functions, Product 1 is a months-scale solo effort and proceeds. If recovery is poor, re-scope to
  "assisted re-implementation of just the gsvc Phase-A body" (much smaller) and stop there.

### Phase 1 — Infrastructure (1–2 weeks) — 🟡 IN PROGRESS (started 2026-05-30)

**Done this session:**
- **Persistence confirmed.** The Ghidra `.rep` is 173 MB and fully analyzed/durable (the 0-byte
  `.gpr` is just a pointer file — no problem). The portable source of truth is the scripts + TSVs;
  the `.rep` is a regenerable local cache (re-run `Phase1ApplyRtti` to rebuild symbols on any clone).
- **RTTI applied as persistent symbols** (`Phase1ApplyRtti.java`): 523 class namespaces, 1,992
  vftable labels, **5,207 DEFAULT methods renamed into `Class::vfunc_<slot>`** (93 hand-named
  preserved). `FUN_` defaults dropped 20,558 → **15,543**; class-qualified functions now **5,583**.
  Saved into the project — every future decompile resolves vtable calls to real class names
  (verified: the movement path now shows e.g. `OutgoingEventQueueClass::vfunc_1`, the command/event
  queue — a direct rewrite target).
- **Batch decompiler** (`DecompileAt.java` + `just decomp <rva…>` / `just decomp-list <file>`):
  reusable, replaces the one-off `Phase5Decomp*` scripts; outputs to `decomp/<rva>.c` with current
  names. Smoke-tested on the sim-core hot path (387400/3a76b0/28d400).
- `ExportFunctions.java` now emits fully-qualified names (`Class::method`).

- **Call-graph attribution DONE** (`Phase1CallGraphAttrib.java`): conservative rule (callers all in
  one class; ≥2 class-callers or sole caller), iterated to fixpoint in 7 rounds (1731→586→145→35→9→2
  →0 — exponential decay = attribution propagating down the call tree). **+2,508 helpers attributed →
  8,097 class-owned functions (37% of 21,744).** Attributed helpers keep their `FUN_` name (DEFAULT
  source) under a class namespace (`WalkLocomotorBehaviorClass::FUN_140386170`) — provenance stays
  explicit: inferred owner, not an RTTI method. Spot-checked correct (locomotor helpers cluster under
  their concrete subclasses; movement helpers in the 0x37xxxx–0x38xxxx neighborhood).
  - **Known gap — indirect-dispatch roots.** The gsvc/movement hot path (`FUN_14028d400` →
    `FUN_1403a76b0` → `FUN_140387400`) is *not* auto-attributed: it's reached by stored
    function-pointer / registered-callback dispatch (`3a76b0` walks an array at `*(this+0x2d0)` and
    calls through it), and Ghidra's static call graph has no edge for indirect calls. These roots are
    already hand-mapped (openspec) and get confirmed when lifted in Phase 3. Optional future tool: an
    indirect-dispatch resolver (map callback-registration sites / vtable-slot writes → callee).

- **Differential-test harness DONE** (`winmm_proxy.c`, `a76b0_hook`): a per-tick movement-state
  fingerprint — the correctness oracle for Phases 3–4. Once per sim tick (detected via the frame
  counter `DAT_140b0a320`/RVA 0xb0a320) it emits an FNV-1a hash over every active locomotor
  component the coordinator services, folding value-deterministic fields {iteration index, entity
  motion-state `+0x48`, component speed-float `+0x28`, countdown `+0x58`}; enumeration mirrors
  `FUN_1403a76b0` exactly (coordinator `+0x2d0` list, `+0x10` count, `+0x8` ptr array, entity at
  element `+0x20`, active iff `+0x4d`==1). Output: `DIFFTRACE\ttick=…\tn=…\th=…` log lines.
  - **Build/gate:** profile-build only (`#ifdef EAW_PROFILE`; release carries 0 `DIFFTRACE`
    symbols — verified), runtime-enabled by `EAW_DIFFTRACE=1`. Capture: `just difftrace=1
    launch-foc-desktop`, load a tactical battle, then `grep DIFFTRACE eaw-mt.log` (written to the
    process CWD = repo root, not `corruption/`). Both builds compile clean; in-game smoke test
    confirmed the profile DLL loads with all fixes active and no startup regression. Actual per-tick
    lines require a tactical battle (movement coordinator only runs there) — that's the golden-trace
    capture step, done when the rewrite work in Phase 3 needs a baseline.
  - **Coverage note:** v1 fingerprints the movement *state machine* (which entities serviced, in
    what order, with what cadence/speed) — catches iteration-order, entity-set, and cadence
    divergence. Raw transform/position values are added once Phase 2 recovers the entity layout; the
    framework is the deliverable, the hashed field set is a knob.

**Phase 1 COMPLETE.** Next: Phase 2 (struct recovery) — folds in the struct DB and unlocks
transform-value coverage in the harness.

#### (Original Phase-1 plan, for reference)
Turn the one-function-at-a-time workflow into a pipeline.

- **Persistent, fully-analyzed, type-propagated Ghidra project**, committed/shareable (or a headless
  re-analysis recipe). All Phase-0 RTTI/string naming applied and saved.
- **Batch decompile export.** Headless `DecompileScript` over all sim-core functions → versioned C
  dump under `decomp/` (regenerable, diffable). Today we decompile by hand into `logs/Phase5Decomp*`;
  make it a `just decomp <rva>` + `just decomp-all` recipe.
- **Struct/type database in-project.** As layouts are recovered they're applied as Ghidra types so
  every downstream decompile is readable (`entity->target` not `*(param+0x38)`). This compounds.
- **Differential-test harness.** Extend the hook DLL: per-tick canonical checksum of world state
  (entity transforms/health/targets, RNG state, command queue). Capture golden traces from saves +
  replays. This is the correctness oracle for everything lifted in Phases 3–4.

### Phase 2 — Struct & type recovery — ✅ SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE 2026-05-30 — *the foundation*

Done (`openspec/data_structures/movement_structs.md`). Phase 2 not only recovered layouts but
**corrected the sim-tick architecture** the original Phase-3 plan was based on. Key results:

- **Sim-tick spine, mapped end-to-end** (was unknown / mislabeled before): `FUN_1403639d0`
  (sim-frame update) → `FUN_1402be640` (GOM entity-list iterator) → `FUN_1403a6b80` (per-GameObject
  update: behavior loop + hardpoints + recurse into children).
- **`GameObjectClass`**: `+0x78/+0x7c/+0x80` = **world position** (the sim x/y/z floats, 4 readers),
  `+0xa8` locomotor state, `+0x4d` active, `+0x4e` render-node gate, `+0x278`/`+0x290` = **behavior
  array/count**, `+0x2d0` hardpoint vector, `+0x38` listener list, `+0x2d8` lua ctx.
- **GOM**: master per-tick list = `ReferenceListClass<GameObjectClass>` at **`GOM+0xe8`** (sentinel
  `+0xf0`, head `+0xf8`); owning `MultiLinkedListClass` at `+0x408`. **Double-buffer set** = the
  `GameObjectClass` instances reachable from `GOM+0xe8`.
- **The mover ≠ what we thought.** `a76b0`/`387400` (long called "movement") is actually
  **`HardPointClass` weapon fire-control** (live RTTI). The real mover is
  **`LocomotorBehaviorClass::vfunc_6`** (vtable slot 6, per type), driven from `FUN_1403a6b80`.
- **Determinism inputs**: tick `DAT_140b0a320`, rate `DAT_140b0a340`, FF gate `0x9cf314`, game-speed
  mode (`DAT_140b15418` vfunc `0xe0`).
- **Oracle upgraded**: DIFFTRACE folds movement state machine **+ world position** **+ hardpoint
  state** — validated in-game (smooth moving-ship `DTPOS` trajectory).

Residual (non-blocking): label the 11 GOM category index-lists; resolve the `HardPoint+0x20`
owner-record class; apply recovered layouts as Ghidra types for readability.

### Phase 3 — Sim-core function lift — 🟢 SCOPED 2026-05-30 (post-Phase-2) — *the critical path*

> The original Phase-3 list (kept at the bottom of this section for history) was drafted **before**
> Phase 2 and is **wrong about the architecture**: it called the hardpoint fire-control path
> (`387010`/`387400`) "movement" and never mentioned the GOM iterator, the per-entity driver, or the
> behavior-dispatch model. This is the corrected, concrete scope.

**The real per-tick sim spine (Phase-2 result):**
```
FUN_1403639d0                       sim-frame update   (advances tick DAT_140b0a320)
  └─ FUN_1402be640(GOM)             iterate GOM+0xe8 ReferenceList<GameObject> (2 passes)
       └─ FUN_1403a6b80(entity)     per-GameObject update; recurses into child/contained units
            ├─ behavior loop: for b in entity[+0x278][0..+0x290]:
            │     if b enabled (b+0x3c==0) & scheduled (b+0x30<=tick): b->vfunc_6(entity, tick)
            │        └─ LocomotorBehavior::vfunc_6 (per type) → integrate → entity+0x78 position
            └─ FUN_1403a76b0(entity) → hardpoint fire-control (387010→387400 target acquisition)
```

**Lift order** (dependency order; each unit validated against the DIFFTRACE oracle before anything
depends on it):

1. **Tick clock / scheduler & determinism inputs.** ✅ **LIFTED 2026-05-30** →
   `sim/tick_clock.{h,cpp}` (+ `sim/tests/tick_clock_test.cpp`, `just sim-test`, all green).
   Lifted the global frame-clock singleton at `&DAT_140b0a320` and its four driver functions, all
   called once/loop-iteration from `FUN_14005d990` (WinMain):
   - `FUN_14027c360` → `tick_advance` — `++DAT_140b0a320` (the authoritative sim tick) + a
     ticks/sec meter. Struct: tick `+0x00`, ticked-flag `+0x14`, sim_fps `+0x1c`, meter anchors
     `+0x38/+0x3c`.
   - `FUN_14027c2f0` → `render_frame_advance` — a **separate** render-frame counter at `+0x04`
     (+ its own fps meter `+0x40/+0x48/+0x4c`); sim-irrelevant (present path only).
   - `FUN_14027c330` → `realtime_accumulate` — wall-clock seconds accumulator at `+0xb09c`.
   - `FUN_14027c5f0` → `should_run_sim_tick` — **the per-frame scheduler**. Key result: it is a
     **fixed-timestep scheduler with an MP lockstep frame-synchronizer**. SP/Replay (`DAT_140b153f8`
     ∈ {0,3}): advance one tick every `1000/cap` ms where `cap = fps_cap (+0x18)`, clamped to 120
     under fast-forward (`+0xb0b5`) or 30 under slow (`+0x37`); stamps `last_tick_time (+0x50)`;
     also honors a hard pause (`+0x34`) and a pause-edge / single-step debug facility
     (`+0xb0b0..b3`). MP (`{1,2,4}`): the `FrameSynchronizer` — refuse to advance past `MaxAhead`
     (`+0x08`) or before every peer's commands for the target frame arrive (the "FrameSynchronizer
     waiting for player…" path; per-player tables at `+0x54` / ptr `+0xc68`, player list
     `DAT_140a16fd0`, command mgr `DAT_140b15690`).
   - **Determinism note:** the MP lockstep gate IS the hardest Phase-4 constraint (lockstep MP /
     replay). It is encapsulated behind `IFrameSynchronizer` and deferred to Phase 4 (the per-player
     table walk); the SP fixed-timestep path is fully lifted and host-validated. The FF gate
     `DAT_1409cf314` is the WinMain *idle* gate (skips `WaitMessage`), not a field of this struct —
     it lets the loop spin so the scheduler's cadence governs tick rate.
   - The tick clock stays **serial** in the rewrite (parallelism is *within* a tick); lifting it
     first pins the tick every later unit is diffed against.
2. **Entity-update spine.** ✅ **LIFTED 2026-05-30** → `sim/entity_spine.{h,cpp}` (+
   `sim/tests/entity_spine_test.cpp`, all green). `FUN_1403639d0` → `FUN_1402be640` →
   `FUN_1403a6b80`, the dispatch *skeleton* with per-unit bodies as `EntityUpdateHooks`:
   - `FUN_1403639d0` → `sim_frame_update` — the sim frame updates **two** GameObjectManagers
     (`param_1[3]`, `param_1[4]`) with the same tick.
   - `FUN_1402be640` → `gom_update` — the master-list (`GOM+0xe8`) per-entity pass. ReferenceList
     walk `node+0x8` next, `entity = *(node+0x18) - 0x18`, head→sentinel; iteration ORDER preserved
     (modeled as an ordered list). The full function's second per-entity post-pass, the
     `second_update_list` transform pass (run with the sim tick saved/restored so it does *not*
     advance the clock), the deferred-spawn drain, and game-mode housekeeping are documented
     ordering anchors, lifted with their owning units.
   - `FUN_1403a6b80` → `update_game_object` — the per-GameObject driver. `mode_flag` (param_3) fast
     path: when set, skip blocks 1 & 4, run only the tail regen. The **behavior-dispatch loop**
     iterates `entity+0x278[]` **in reverse** (count `+0x290` − 1 → 0, index masked to a byte),
     gating each on schedule (`behavior+0x30 <= tick`) and enabled (`FUN_1404c3700` = `+0x3c == 0`),
     calling vtable slot 6. Intra-tick order pinned: locomotor pre-step → per-entity timed-action
     drain → behaviors → hardpoint fire-control → tail regen roll. **This loop is the Phase-A body
     the rewrite parallelizes over entities.**
   - **CORRECTION:** `FUN_1403a6b80` does **not** self-recurse — there is no child-unit recursion
     (earlier notes were wrong). The GOM master list is flat; contained units are separate entries,
     iterated independently. (Better for parallelization — no nested-update ordering to preserve.)
   - **CONFIRMATION:** `entity+0x60/+0x68` is a `DynamicVector` of 0x38-stride timed-action records
     (countdown `+0xc`), **not** a `std::string` — independently confirming the Phase-2
     disambiguation that the `+0x60` std::string belongs to the HardPoint owner record, not
     `GameObjectClass`.
   - **Determinism notes:** behavior reverse-order + GOM list order + timed-action fire-on-zero
     ordering are all preserved; the tail regen roll draws RNG (Phase-4 pin).
3. **Locomotor movement integrators (the Phase-A body).** 🟢 **FIRST CUT LIFTED 2026-05-30** →
   `sim/locomotor.{h,cpp}` (+ `sim/tests/locomotor_test.cpp`, all green). Lifted for the **Starship**
   type, establishing the shared model every locomotor reuses:
   - **Data model:** `LocomotorState` (entity+0xa8) — velocity `+0x14/18/1c`, prev-pos `+0x2c/30/34`,
     state `+0x48`, substate `+0x50`, turn_rate `+0x54`, countdown `+0x5c`, vert_step `+0x60`,
     docking anchors `+0x88/+0xa0` — and the `LocoState` enum (0 Idle / 1 Accelerate / 2,3 Turn,
     Cruise / 4 PostMoveWait / 5 Burst / 6 Decelerate / 7 Stopped / 8 Docking).
   - **Primitives (concrete):** `set_position` (`FUN_1403a8f90` — writes `entity+0x78`, sets the
     transform-dirty flag `0x100` via the `+0x3a1` byte → **confirms `0x100` = transform dirty**),
     `reschedule` (`LocomotorCommonClass::vfunc_6` `0x4c2f70` — sets `behavior+0x30 = +0x34 + tick`,
     the schedule gate the spine reads), `set_state` (`0x559250`), `rotate_xz`/`rotate_xy`
     (`0x4aaa40`/`0x2bab90` 2D rotations with the engine's small-angle fast path).
   - **`starship_tick` (`0x6236b0` skeleton):** pre-step → read `entity+0x78` → switch on
     `state+0x48` → core velocity integration + terrain-follow vertical clamp (toward
     `destination.z + terrain` at `max_climb_rate`) → write `entity+0x78` → **arrival FSM**
     (substate `0xa → fire "arriving"(9) → 0xb`; within `arrival_threshold` → fire "arrived"(10) →
     `9`). The arrival events are **cross-entity listener writes = Phase-B commands** in the rewrite.
   - **accel→velocity integrator LIFTED (`FUN_1406224b0` → `integrate_velocity`, 2026-05-30):** the
     deterministic producer of the per-tick velocity that drives `entity+0x78`. Rotates the
     template's base accel (`LocomotorTemplate+0x384` × `state.accel_factor+0x54`) by the entity
     heading (`+0x88/+0x8c`), adds to velocity (`state+0x14/18/1c`), clamps to `max_speed+0x37c`
     (scale by max²/speed²), applies steering-alignment damping when `state.steer_blend+0x58 > 0`
     (per-axis `damp_axis` toward `|vel|·unit_accel`, gain `DAT_1408754bc·blend`), then drag
     (`+0x398`). Introduced `LocomotorTemplate` (the `entity+0x298` tuning block). Default
     `LocomotorEnv::integrate_accel` runs it when the entity has a template.
   - **Still behind `LocomotorEnv` (each its own future sub-unit):** the steering-decision bodies
     (accelerate `622b80`, turn `622e90` — set `accel_factor`/`steer_blend`/heading target), burst,
     docking + world queries (destination `623340`, terrain height `135140`, max climb `372440`,
     arrival threshold, listener events). **TODO:** lift Walk `0x61e930` + the other ~13 subclasses
     (same vfunc_6 contract) and the steering bodies.
   - **Constants RECOVERED 2026-05-30** (`tools/ghidra_scripts/ReadFloats.java`): the "game-speed
     scale" `(DAT_1408007dc·DAT_1408007d4)/DAT_1408007f4` = `(π·2)/360` = **2π/360 = degrees→radians**
     — so the entity heading (`+0x88/+0x8c`) is in **degrees**. Steering gain `DAT_1408754bc` = 1.0;
     `DAT_1407ffaf8` = 1.0; `DAT_1408007f8` = 1000.0 (confirms `realtime_accumulate`'s ms/sec);
     `DAT_140800860` = `0x80000000` (float sign-flip mask). Baked into `sim/locomotor.{h,cpp}`
     (`DEG2RAD`, `STEER_GAIN`).
   - **In-game oracle attempt 2026-05-30 — INCONCLUSIVE (wrong unit type in the available scenario).**
     Added a `DTVEL` capture to the DIFFTRACE harness (`winmm_proxy.c`: per tick, the sampled ship's
     locomotor velocity `state+0x14/18/1c` + state `+0x48`) + an offline checker
     (`tools/analyze_loco_oracle.py`) for the invariant `pos[t]-pos[t-1] == velocity[t]`. Captured
     the menu-demo space battle (1052 ticks, 2 ships). Result: **both sampled ships are
     capital/Fleet-class locomotors, NOT the Starship type** — `+0x14/18/1c` is a **unit direction
     vector** (`|v|≡1.0`) with speed stored elsewhere (displacement = dir × a separately-varying
     scale, e.g. ×750 in cruise), and their state codes are `19/22/44` (∉ the Starship enum `0..8`).
     The Starship integrator (`6236b0` lines 211-214) adds `state+0x14/18/1c` **directly** to position
     → for a Starship that field IS raw per-tick velocity; these capital ships are a **different
     locomotor family** with a normalized-direction representation. The menu background demo contains
     no maneuvering Starship-class units, so it cannot validate the Starship lift. **To close the
     Starship oracle:** capture a battle with maneuvering Starship-class units (fighter/corvette;
     player-driven or a loaded save). The lift itself remains internally consistent (16 host checks);
     validation is blocked on test data, not a known defect.
   - **Starship auto-targeting added 2026-05-30** (`winmm_proxy.c` `dt_loco_vtbl_rva`): the harness
     scans each ship's behavior array (`coord+0x278`/`+0x290`) for its locomotor vtable, tags `DTVEL`
     with the family (`loco=<rva>`), and emits a dedicated `DTVELS` line for the first ship whose
     locomotor is a `StarshipLocomotorBehaviorClass` (`0x8ae250`) — so a future battle capture
     auto-targets the right units. `analyze_loco_oracle.py` reports families and prefers `DTVELS`.
     Verified in-game (no fault): the menu-demo space ships are 100% `SimpleSpaceLocomotorBehaviorClass`
     (`0x8aeaf8`), `DTVELS`=0.
   - **SimpleSpace dispatch skeleton LIFTED 2026-05-30** → `sim/locomotor` `simplespace_tick`
     (`FUN_140626420` + `SimpleSpaceEnv`; 6 host checks). SimpleSpace is the **common space mover**
     (behavior census's representative space unit; 100% of menu-demo ships). Its `vfunc_6` is a thin
     dispatcher: a special-mode gate (`vfunc_66` = `state+0x260`) routing states `4/5/0x28/0x2c` to
     handlers, else the normal state machine `Init(0) → Moving(0x13) → Arrived(0x16)`. Moving calls
     the **mover virtual** (`vfunc_59` = `0x625990`, **2354 B**) to compute the new pos/vel, writes
     position via the shared `set_position` (`FUN_1403a8f90`), and transitions to Arrived on
     completion or no-motion; Arrived bleeds residual speed and clears `state+0xec`. Velocity model:
     **unit direction at `state+0x14/18/1c` + speed scalar at `state+0xec`** (≠ Starship's raw
     velocity — the two families differ). The 2354-B mover (`vfunc_59`) is the deep callout; **lifting
     it is the bit-exact oracle step** (the menu capture already confirms displacement is *along* the
     `state+0x14/18/1c` direction, `dir·disp ≈ 1.0`).
   - **Locomotor structure is uniform:** every type = a thin `vfunc_6` dispatcher over a large
     per-type mover (Starship integrator `6224b0`; SimpleSpace mover `625990`). The dispatcher
     skeletons + shared model/primitives are lifted; each mover is its own sizable sub-lift.
   - **SimpleSpace mover (`vfunc_59` = `0x625990`) is a Hermite spline path-follower** — it
     interpolates a precomputed curve (control points in `state+0x18`, indexed by `state+0x60`) with a
     4×4 basis matrix (`DAT_140b2f200…`) + quaternion orientation ops. Full bit-exact lift would also
     need the live spline state captured — a large effort. **But its straight-line / path-complete
     branch (lines 67-76/191-199 + `FUN_14041c000`) is lifted** → `simplespace_straight_move`:
     `out_pos = in_pos + (cos(h·DEG2RAD), sin(h·DEG2RAD), 0)·speed`, `h = entity+0x8c` (deg),
     `speed = state+0xec`, Z held. This is the **dominant steady-cruise behavior** (the menu ships fly
     straight lines). Host-validated (reproduces the menu cruise displacement, 23 locomotor checks).
   - **✅ FIRST IN-GAME ORACLE PASS — 2026-05-30** (`tools/analyze_loco_oracle.py` on a menu-demo
     capture). The lifted **direction-from-heading** and **move-along-facing** reproduce the live
     binary **bit-exact**:
     - `dir = (cos(hd·DEG2RAD), sin(hd·DEG2RAD), 0)` matches the engine's `state+0x14/18/1c` to
       **≤1e-4 on 182 facing-driven ticks** — validating the `DEG2RAD` constant + `FUN_14041c000` +
       the cos/sin direction extraction against ground truth.
     - displacement is exactly along that direction: **`disp ∥ dir` on 150/150 moving ticks**.
     This is the **first end-to-end proof of the lift-and-validate methodology** (host lift → in-game
     differential trace → bit-exact agreement). **Correction from the run:** the move MAGNITUDE is
     **not** `state+0xec` (that field is a 0..1 throttle, often 0); it is spline/special-mode driven —
     and the menu ships are mostly in **special mode `0x2c`** (`FUN_1406269f0`).
   - **✅ FULL-POSITION ORACLE PASS — 2026-05-30 (the 0x2c drift mover lifted + validated).** Lifted
     `FUN_1406269f0` → `simplespace_drift_move`: the timed fly-in animation the menu ships use. Over
     timer ticks `[0x19, 0x96)` (`timer = state+0x5c`, pre-incremented), `new_pos = owner_pos +
     normalize(state+0x14/18/1c) · table[timer]`, where `table` = the runtime 150-float speed curve
     `DAT_140b31440` (`FUN_14049d400`'s lookup; the static image is **zero** — loaded from game data
     at runtime, so the harness dumps it live as `DTTAB` lines). Captured `tm=state+0x5c` per tick +
     the table, and **`|disp| == table[timer]` matched 123/123 move-window ticks bit-exact** — so the
     lifted **complete per-tick position** (direction × magnitude) reproduces the live binary. The
     table is a plateau of `750.0` over the cruise timers then ramps. **This is the first
     full-position differential pass.** The setup (`<0x19`) and cleanup (`>=0x96`) phases don't move;
     the cross-entity events at `timer==0x2d`/`0x78` are presentation/command-side (out of slice).
     Harness: `DTVEL` carries `hd`/`sp`/`tm`; `DTTAB` dumps the runtime table.
     **Operational lesson: stop the game with `pkill -9 -f StarWarsG.exe` ONLY — never broadly kill
     `steam`/`proton` (Proton needs the user's Steam client; it can't be restarted headless).**
   - **Hermite spline mover (`vfunc_59` = `0x625990`) — algorithm LIFTED + basis matrix confirmed.**
     `hermite_spline_eval`: the `Moving(0x13)` curved-path follower is a 2D cubic Hermite over the
     control-point array at `state+0x18` (stride `0x34`, index `state+0x60`; node = `[0..2]`pos,
     `[3..5]`tangent, `[6]`weight, `[0xc]`arc-param). For each of x,y: `out = c0 + c1·t + c2·t² + c3·t³`,
     `t = clamp((tick−p0.arc)/(p1.arc−p0.arc),0,1)`, `cᵣ = basisRowᵣ · [p0, p1, m0, m1]` with scaled
     endpoint tangents `mᵢ = normalize(tangentᵢ)·(weightᵢ·arclen)` (`FUN_140139800` = vec3-normalize);
     **z held**. Helpers: `FUN_14054fc00` (node accessor, stride `0x34`), `FUN_1405c5910`
     (path-complete = on last segment), `FUN_1405c4920` (advance segment). The 4×4 basis matrix
     `DAT_140b2f1f0` is runtime-loaded (static zero) — **captured live (`DTMAT`) and it equals the
     standard cubic-Hermite matrix EXACTLY** (`[1,0,0,0; 0,0,1,0; -3,3,-2,-1; 2,-2,1,1]`), matching the
     lifted form. Host-validated (5 checks). **Full in-game spline-position oracle is NOT reachable
     from the menu demo:** its `0x13` ships have no multi-segment spline (`DTSPL=0` over 2425 `0x13`
     ticks — they use the straight/path-complete branch), so the Hermite interpolation only runs for
     player-issued **curved** move orders. So the spline *algorithm* + its *runtime basis matrix* are
     validated; the end-to-end position match for it awaits a curved-path capture (`DTMAT`+`DTSPL`
     harness is ready). Decompiled helpers: `decomp/{625990,139800,54fc00,5c5910,5c4920,49d400,6269f0}.c`.
   - **✅ FULL-POSITION ORACLE PASS — 2026-05-31 — Fighter locomotor family (`FighterLocomotorBehaviorClass`,
     vtable `0x8a6198`).** A real capital-ship battle (`[NR] han trollo - space battle`, capture
     `logs/battle_capture_085808.log`) exposed a SECOND, DOMINANT space mover the menu demo never
     touches: **82% of battle ticks** (7979 vs SimpleSpace's 1740). vfunc_6 = `0x5cb830` dispatches on
     `state+0x48` in two halves — a normal-flight path (base `LocomotorCommonClass::vfunc_6` + heading
     integration over `entity+0x84/88/8c`, trig `FUN_14020b6d0/710`, writeback `FUN_1403a8710`) with a
     switch over flight states {`0x1b` Move→`5ce010`, `0x1c` Strafe→`5cd8e0`, `0x1e` Engage→`5cc220`
     (dominant), `0x1d` Idle, `0x1f` Break→`5cbea0`}; and a special-mode half {`0x04`/`0x05`/`0x28`/`0x2c`}.
     Unlike SimpleSpace (planar, `vz≡0`, unit-dir+scalar), this family stores **raw 3D per-tick velocity**
     at `state+0x14/18/1c` (same representation as Starship). Every flight-state mover steers then
     commits `new_pos = owner_pos(+0x78/7c/80) + velocity` via `FUN_1403a8f90` → lifted as the trivial
     `fighter_integrate`. **In-game oracle: per-tick displacement == captured velocity BIT-EXACT on
     7918/7918 flight-state ticks** (`tools/analyze_loco_oracle.py` `check_fighter`). The only 4
     non-matching fighter ticks were transient `0x2c` drift and match the already-lifted
     `simplespace_drift_move` (`|disp|==table[timer]==750`). This confirms the family identity, the
     velocity representation, and the integrator.
   - **✅ Fighter steering VELOCITY PRODUCER lifted + validated (2026-05-31).** The per-state movers
     call a 3D pursuit-steering controller `FUN_1405caaf0`: build the entity's inverse-orientation
     matrix from its angles (climb `+0x88`, heading `+0x8c`, DEG2RAD), transform `target−owner_pos`
     into the LOCAL frame, take yaw/pitch bearing errors (`FUN_14020acd0`), integrate the heading
     angles toward the target turn-rate-limited (`FUN_1405c95a0` yaw / `FUN_1405c8fb0` pitch, rates
     from `FUN_1403724d0/372560`), then throttle speed and recompute velocity (`FUN_1405c9360`);
     max-speed cap = `FUN_1405ca390`→`FUN_140370f00` (template+0x37c, same as Starship). **Lifted the
     deterministic velocity producer `FUN_1405c9360`** → `fighter_heading_dir` + `fighter_throttle_velocity`:
     `velocity = speed · (cosα·cosβ, cosα·sinβ, −sinα)` (α=climb `+0x88`, β=heading `+0x8c`, deg), with
     `speed` rate-limited toward max each tick. For level flight (α=0) this collapses to the SimpleSpace
     planar form `(cosβ,sinβ,0)`. **In-game validation:** XY heading `atan2(vy,vx)==β==hd` on 7948/7965
     flight ticks, and the full 3D decomposition (α from vz) reproduces vx,vy on 7952/7974 — the ~0.3%
     residual is the `cosα<0` (|α|>90°) branch, consistent with the formula. Host test: 3 golden
     velocity samples + throttle stepping.
     Decompiled: `decomp/{5cb830,5cc220,5ce010,5cd8e0,5c9ca0,5caaf0,5ca390,5cb750,5c8b70,5c9360,5c95a0,5c8fb0,20acd0,3a8710,20b6d0,20b710,3724d0,372560}.c`. NB: this same
     capture re-confirmed the prior two oracles at 100% (SimpleSpace direction 848/848, 0x2c drift
     790/790). New tool: `tools/ghidra_scripts/DumpVtable.java` (vtable-slot dumper).
   - **✅ Fighter steering HEADING-INTEGRATOR primitives lifted (2026-05-31).** Lifted the deterministic
     pieces of steps 1-3 of `FUN_1405caaf0`: (a) the engine angle wraps `wrap180`/`wrap360`
     (`FUN_14020b6d0` → `(-180,180]`, the bearing-ERROR form; `FUN_14020b710` → `[0,360)`, the stored
     form) using `DAT_1408524f8/fc=±180`, `DAT_1408007f4=360`; (b) the local-frame bearing
     `fighter_target_bearing` (`FUN_14020acd0`): `azimuth=atan2(y,x)°∈[0,360)` (→ yaw `+0x8c`),
     `elevation=−atan2(z,hypot(x,y))°` (→ pitch `+0x88`), roll=0; (c) the turn-rate-limited angle step
     `fighter_turn_angle` = exactly `FUN_1405c8fb0` (the pitch integrator): `wrap180(cur)`, step by
     min(|err|, budget) toward the error and consume it, `wrap360` the result; write-back gate is
     `FUN_1403a8710` (skips when `entity+0x3a0 & 0x10`, mirrors `+0x84/88/8c` to `+0x90/94/98`).
     Confirmed math runtimes: `FUN_1407760bc=fabsf`, `FUN_14078437c=atan2f`. Host test: angle wraps +
     7 bearing goldens + turn-step branches (49 locomotor checks total). **NOT committed as lifted:**
     the full `FUN_1405caaf0` orchestration on top — the yaw integrator's roll coupling (`FUN_1405c95a0`),
     the ±180° hard-turn snap, and the game-speed-scaled per-tick turn budgets read from the unit
     template (`order+0x38c/0x394/0x3a0` via `FUN_140372560/3724d0/372440`, scaled by the
     `DAT_140b16dbc/dc0/dc4` speed-mode multipliers). Validating those needs the target + budgets +
     pitch in the DIFFTRACE harness (it logs only heading `+0x8c`) — a further harness-gated sub-lift.
   - **✅ DIFFTRACE extended with the steering-controller capture (DTSTEER, 2026-05-31).** The
     controller's true input — the steering TARGET — is a stack local the mover computes and passes
     as `FUN_1405caaf0` param_2 (`decomp/5cc220.c:180-223`), so it's invisible to the read-only fold.
     Added an inline-trampoline wrapper on `FUN_1405caaf0` (14-byte prologue, FF25; profile-build only,
     `EAW_DIFFTRACE=1`) that latches one maneuvering fighter and emits a **DTSTEER** line per tick with
     the controller's complete I/O: owner pos, target (param_2), roll/pitch/yaw **before & after**
     (`entity+0x84/88/8c`), yaw budget (`*param_4`), pitch budget (`*param_6`), speed budget
     (`*param_5`), commanded max speed (param_3 float→xmm2), locomotor state (`state+0x48`), hard-turn
     flag (`state+0x1d4`). Decompiled the inverse-orientation transform it relies on: `FUN_1402cf9e0`
     = in-place Ry(−pitch) (rotates the X–Z matrix columns), `FUN_1400480f0` = Rz(−yaw) (X–Y columns),
     both with the IEEE small-angle fast path (`FUN_140776650/776150` = sin/cos); so the local target
     = `Rz(−yaw)·Ry(−pitch)·(target−owner)`, then `fighter_target_bearing`. `tools/analyze_loco_oracle.py`
     gained `check_steer`: (A) continuity (`after[t]==before[t+1]`, capture coherence) and (B) the
     **pitch channel** — the clean `FUN_1405c8fb0` path — reproduced offline as `fighter_turn_angle(p0,
     wrap180(elevation), pitch_budget) == p1` (yaw stays informational, being roll-coupled). Hook
     installs clean in-game (prologue matched, no regression). Decompiled `decomp/{2cf9e0,480f0}.c`.
   - **✅ DTSTEER PITCH ORACLE PASS — heading-integrator primitives validated in-game (2026-05-31).**
     A fighter battle produced **10,602 controller ticks** of one latched maneuvering fighter. Oracle 5:
     **(B) pitch channel = 9831/9840 = 99.9%** on clean (`ht==0`) ticks — `fighter_turn_angle`,
     `fighter_target_bearing`, `wrap180/360`, and the offline `Rz(−yaw)·Ry(−pitch)` transform are
     bit-faithful to the live `FUN_1405caaf0` pitch path. **(A) continuity = 10568/10601 = 99.7%.** The
     9 misses share one signature: **waypoint-arrival singularities** (owner≈target, `|target−owner| < ms`
     speed/tick) where the bearing is numerically degenerate and the real controller snaps a full-budget
     step while the offline transform reads err≈0 — expected at the geometric singularity, not a primitive
     bug. **Yaw = 88% on the simple model (roll-coupled / hard-turn-snapped, still unlifted).** First
     in-game confirmation of the lifted bearing + turn-step primitives. Remaining caaf0 lift = yaw
     integrator `FUN_1405c95a0` (roll coupling), ±180° hard-turn snap, near-target degenerate branch.
   - **✅ DTYAW YAW/ROLL INTEGRATOR ORACLE PASS — bank-to-turn channel validated in-game (2026-05-31).**
     Lifted `FUN_1405c95a0` as `fighter_steer_yaw` (`sim/locomotor.{h,cpp}`): the roll-coupled yaw
     channel that `FUN_1405caaf0` calls for the heading axis. Algorithm: (1) commanded bank
     `cy = −clamp(wrap180(yaw_err), ±cap)`; (2) step roll (`entity+0x84`) toward `wrap180(cy−roll0)`
     by `roll_step = clamp((B/A)·budget, 0, 180)` — **budget is NOT spent on roll**; (3) sign-flip
     guard: if `new_roll≠0` and `sign(cy)≠sign(new_roll)`, **zero the budget and skip the yaw step**
     (hold heading until the bank aligns); (4) else step yaw (`entity+0x8c`) with the same turn-step
     primitive as pitch but on the RAW stored angle (no `wrap180(cur)` first — the lone structural
     difference from `FUN_1405c8fb0`); (5) `wrap360` both before write-back. **Key simplification:
     A (`template+0x38c`) and B (`template+0x394`) appear only as the ratio B/A, so the game-speed
     scale both accessors apply cancels — raw template fields suffice; cap (`template+0x39c`) read
     raw.** Isolated via a dedicated **DTYAW** inline-trampoline directly on `FUN_1405c95a0` (18-byte
     relocatable prologue, profile-build only) capturing exact param yaw_err / `*budget` / raw A,B,cap
     and roll/yaw before & after — so the integrator is unit-tested in isolation, no need to rebuild
     the yaw error through the caaf0 pipeline. Oracle 6 (`check_yaw`) reproduces `(roll1, yaw1)`:
     **ROLL = 4006/4006 (100%), YAW = 4006/4006 (100%)** over a fighter battle, with real coverage —
     961 ticks of nonzero yaw error, 917 ticks where roll stepped, 1331 ticks where budget was spent.
     Host goldens pass via `just sim-test`. **`FUN_1405caaf0` heading channels (pitch + yaw/roll) now
     fully lifted and dual-validated.** Remaining caaf0 tail: ±180° hard-turn snap (`state+0x1d4`) and
     the near-target degenerate branch.
   - **✅ HARD-TURN SNAP ORACLE PASS — bank-to-turn override validated in-game (2026-05-31).** Lifted
     `FUN_1405caaf0` lines 82-98 as `fighter_hard_turn` (`sim/locomotor.{h,cpp}`): the latched override
     the controller applies before dispatching to the integrators when the target sits nearly **dead
     astern**, where bank-to-turn can't pick a turn direction. While engaged it forces **pitch to full
     ±180°** (`sign(pitch_err)·180` = `DAT_1408524f8/fc`, into `FUN_1405c8fb0`) and **zeroes the yaw
     command** — the fighter pitches over (loop/split-S) to bring the target back into its forward arc
     instead of yawing onto something behind it. The latch (`state+0x1d4`) is **hysteretic**: engage
     when `|yaw_err| > 170°` (within 10° of dead astern) AND `state != 0x1c` AND
     `FUN_140372440(template+0x298) > 0`; once engaged, **hold while `|yaw_err| ≥ 90°`** (the hold path
     bypasses the state/gate test); release when `|yaw_err| < 90°`. Both thresholds were **recovered
     empirically** from the existing DTSTEER capture — `tools/recover_snap_thresholds.py` mines the
     latch transitions vs `|yaw_err|`: release `DAT_1408007ec` brackets `(89.671, 90.264] → 90.0`,
     engage `DAT_1408a650c` brackets `(169.852, 170.139] → 170.0`. No new harness needed: DTSTEER
     already captures `ht` (`state+0x1d4`) before each tick, so `ht[t+1]` is the latch the controller
     wrote at `t`. Oracle 7 (`check_snap`) over a fighter battle (ent `0x2dc2ff00`, **762 hard-turn
     ticks**): **(A) LATCH reproduced = 10578/10578 (100%)**, **(B) PITCH override
     `turn(p0, sign(pe)·180, pb) == p1` on snap ticks = 759/760 (99.9%)** — the lone miss is the
     **elevation≈0 sign degeneracy** at exactly dead astern (target co-planar, `|elev| < 1e-4`, where
     the engine's float `atan2` and the offline double disagree on `±0`), the same near-target
     singularity as the 9 pitch misses, not a model fault. Host goldens pass via `just sim-test`
     (`test_fighter_hard_turn`: engage/hold/release/gate cases). `gate_ok` (`FUN_140372440 > 0`) held
     for every fighter tick in the capture, so it's modeled True; the snap branch and both heading
     integrators are now done.
   - **✅ ROLL-COMP YAW WRAP ORACLE PASS — `FUN_1405caaf0` fully lifted (2026-05-31).** Lifted lines
     100-109 (`LAB_1405cad66`) as `fighter_roll_comp_yaw` (`sim/locomotor.{h,cpp}`): the **last step
     before the yaw integrator**. It adds the roll-induced yaw to the commanded yaw and, if the COMBINED
     magnitude would exceed 180°, **wraps `yaw_cmd` toward zero by 360°** so the roll-coupled integrator
     (`fighter_steer_yaw`) banks the short way around instead of unwinding the long way:
     `term = a·(wrap180(roll)/b) + yaw_cmd`; `if |term| > 180: yaw_cmd −= sign(yaw_cmd)·360` (constants
     `DAT_1408524f8`=180, `DAT_1407ffaf8`/`14080080c`=±1, `DAT_1408007f4`=360; `sign(0)=+1`). The
     coefficients are `a = template+0x38c` (`FUN_140372560`) and `b = template+0x394` (`FUN_1403724d0`)
     — the **same pair `fighter_steer_yaw` uses**; both accessors apply the identical game-speed scale so
     it **cancels in the `a/b` ratio** (the wrap is difficulty-invariant; raw template fields suffice).
     `roll` is the owner's stored roll (`entity+0x84`), `wrap180`'d. Since `yaw_cmd` is the post-hard-turn
     command (`wrap180` bearing error, or 0 when snapped) with `|yaw_cmd| ≤ 180`, the wrap only fires when
     the roll term pushes a large same-sign `yaw_cmd` past 180°. **Validation (negative oracle):** DTYAW's
     captured `ye` is the yaw command AS HANDED to `FUN_1405c95a0` — i.e. the roll-comp OUTPUT — and the
     wrap moves a value out of `(−180,180]`, so `|ye| > 180 ⟺ the wrap fired`. Across the capture (ent
     `0x2fd020a0`, a=2 b=3, **8971 ticks**) every `|ye| ≤ 180`: **the wrap is dormant in normal flight**,
     so each tick is a no-fire where `ye == pre-wrap command`. Oracle 8 (`check_roll_comp`) feeds each
     `(roll0, ye)` back through the lifted condition and agrees **8971/8971** (engine fired 0, model fired
     0); **closest approach `|term| = 164.2°/180°`** (at roll=228°→−132°, yaw_cmd=−76°) — the branch is
     **reachable to within ~16°, a live edge-case guard, not dead code**. The positive (firing) path is
     covered host-side (`test_fighter_roll_comp_yaw`: same-sign wrap up/down, opposite-sign cancel,
     raw-roll wrap, `=180` boundary no-wrap, `sign(0)`). **`FUN_1405caaf0` is now FULLY LIFTED** — local-
     frame bearing, hard-turn snap, roll-comp wrap, and both heading integrators (pitch + bank-to-turn
     yaw) all validated in-game.
4. **Hardpoint fire-control.** `FUN_1403a76b0` (per-ship fire-budget distribution over the hardpoint
   vector at `entity+0x2d0`, weighted by `hardpoint+0x58` via `540070`), `387010`, `387400`
   (opportunity-target acquisition), capped search `385190` (Fix B2), target set `382510` / release
   `3846c0`, force integrator `387f50`, nav submit `29f810`. **Oracle-validated** (DIFFTRACE folds
   hardpoint `{target, weight +0x28, countdown +0x58}`).

   **🟡 FIRST CUT LIFTED — fire-budget distribution (`sim/hardpoint.{h,cpp}`, host-validated).** Lifted
   `FUN_1403a76b0` as `hardpoint_fire_budget`: pass-1 count active mounts (`present && owner_record &&
   owner_record->active@+0x4d`), pass-2 sum the game-speed-scaled weight (`540070` = `hp+0x58 ×
   {1, DAT_140b16dcc, DAT_140b16dc8}` by game-speed mode), pass-3 distribute `share_i =
   (budget_i/total_w)·avail` and consume via `387f50`, pass-4 `387010` per-mount update over every
   present mount. **KEY FINDING — `total_w` CANCELS:** `avail = (capacity−base)·total_w` then
   `share_i = (budget_i/total_w)·avail = budget_i·(capacity−base)`, so the summed weight *and* the
   `540070` game-speed weight scale are irrelevant to every share — weight only *gates* distribution
   (`avail>0` needs `total_w>0`, i.e. ≥1 active weighted mount). `base = min(fire_fraction+bias, 1.0)`
   (`396df0 + DAT_140b16d78`, clamp `DAT_1407ffaf8=1.0`); `avail` clamped `≥0`. `387f50` consume
   guards (owner-record active, owner match `hp+0x10==ship`, `budget>0`, `share>0`), decrements
   `hp+0x28`, fires (`386660`), and on depletion emits the station-level-lost command (Phase B).
   `387010` dispatcher pins `delta = tick − last_serviced@+0x60` + the motion-state gate
   (`(motion−5)<6 && enable` → `387400`). **Behind `HardpointEnv` (deferred sub-lifts):** the ship
   scalars `fire_fraction`(`396df0`)/`fire_capacity`(`396070`), the shot `386660`, and the deep
   opportunity-target acquisition `FUN_140387400` (1904 B — cross-entity target writes + player-table
   RNG scan + command emission = Phase-A/B-entangled). **✅ `387400`'s determinism-critical core — the
   opportunity-target SCAN — is now LIFTED** (`scan_opportunity_target`, host-validated): a random-start
   (`SimRng::range_i(0,nplayers−1)`) circular sweep of the global player table (`&DAT_140a16fd0`),
   skip-self, fog-stall + score-leak subtleties faithful, first enemy-with-valid-target wins; per-candidate
   accept (`2824f0` diplomacy + `385190` capped search + sentinels) behind `OppScanEnv`. Its RNG seeding is
   already in-game-validated by the DTRNG oracle. The surrounding guard cascade / countdown / state_flag
   branch / command emission stay env-modeled (`HardpointEnv::acquire_targets`). Host: 15 checks
   (`sim/tests/hardpoint_test.cpp`, incl. the scale-cancellation + 6 scan tests) via `just sim-test`. The
   DIFFTRACE per-tick hash already folds `hp+0x28`/`+0x58`, so the distribution's effect is observed;
   a dedicated **DTFIRE** capture (per-tick `total_w`/`avail`/`share`/budget deltas) is the precise
   in-game oracle = the follow-on analysis step.

   **🔬 DTFIRE in-game survey result (2026-05-31) — the phase-1 distribution is DORMANT in TR content.**
   A `FUN_1403a76b0` trampoline (profile build, `EAW_DIFFTRACE=1`, `hooks/winmm_proxy.c`) instrumented
   every ship-tick with ≥2 active mounts and latched before/after budget deltas. Over a full capital
   battle (`logs/dtfire_survey_capbattle.log`, tick 105,984→114,176):
   - `na2_shipticks = 81,302` — plenty of multi-hardpoint capitals engaging;
   - `twpos_shipticks = 72,275` (89%) had `total_w > 0` — weights are *technically* nonzero, **but**
   - `maxtw = 0.000000` for the **entire** battle — the summed weight never exceeded ~5e-7;
   - **`consume_shipticks = 0`** and **0 DTFIRE data lines** — the distribution branch (`387f50`
     consume) decremented `hp+0x28` on **zero** ship-ticks.

   Interpretation: in Thrawn's Revenge content the hardpoint fire-rate weight (`hp+0x58`) is
   sub-microscopic and the phase-1 budget-distribution path **never consumes** — weapons fire entirely
   through the **phase-2 per-mount dispatch** (`387010`→`387400`). The cancellation oracle is therefore
   **unobservable in this mod** (no consumption samples exist to test); the host-validated lift stands
   on its own. **`FUN_140387400` (target acquisition) is the live fire path** and the priority next
   sub-lift — DTFIRE confirmed *that* branch, not the distributor, is what actually fires weapons here.
5. **Cross-entity / global write sites → command emitters.** The compute→apply boundary: every write
   a per-entity update makes to *other* entities or globals — target listener-list registration on
   `target+0x38` (`220e90`/`ed0`/`eb0` via `058570`), the global event queue `DAT_140b27e60`
   (`2d5290`), `OutgoingEventQueueClass`. In the parallel rewrite these defer into a per-thread
   command buffer (Phase B) instead of executing inline.

6. **Command/event queue drain (serial Phase-B apply).** ✅ **DONE for the tactical sim slice.**
   Channel-1 signal/slot fan-out (`240940` + `drain_commands`) and channel-2 presentation SFX cue
   (`drain_sfx`) both lifted & host-validated (above). Both `387400` emission channels are now
   modelled end-to-end. The galactic `OutgoingEventQueueClass` (`b2ed18`) + the `StopMovementEvent`/
   `EventFactoryClass<…>` family are a separate strategic-layer concern, not part of this slice.

**The parallel boundary (concrete, from the above):**
- **Phase A — parallel over entities (steps 2–4):** each entity reads its own + others' *last-tick*
  state and computes its new position/locomotor-state/target, writing **only its own** fields
  (`+0x78`, `+0xa8`, hardpoint slots) and **emitting commands** for anything cross-entity.
  Double-buffer the `GameObject` set reachable from `GOM+0xe8` so reads see frozen last-tick state.
- **Phase B — serial (steps 5–6):** drain command buffers in canonical order (cross-entity listener
  writes, global queue, deferred order creation).
- **Determinism pins (front-loaded into Phase 4):** the `a76b0` fire-budget sum accumulates a float
  across the hardpoint list (**order-sensitive** — preserve iteration order); the GOM iteration
  order; RNG draws inside target acquisition.

**✅ Behavior set RESOLVED 2026-05-30 (runtime `BEHENUM` census + decompile classification).** A
representative space unit carries **~14 behaviors** (`entity+0x278` array, `+0x290` count), each with
its **own** `vfunc_6` override (none inherit the base no-op) — so `FUN_1403a6b80` runs ~14
sub-updates per unit per tick. RTTI named them all; classification (in = mutates determinism-relevant
sim state; out = presentation):

| Behavior class | `vfunc_6` | In/Out | Note |

| `TargetingBehaviorClass` | `0x633a30` | **IN** | weapon target selection (per game-speed mode) |
| `DamageTrackingBehaviorClass` | `0x58bd80` | **IN** | ✅ **LIFTED** (behavior #1) — *not* HP application: a **timed damage/status-effect decay ticker** (own `+0x1a0` list); emits `0x2d` on empty |

In-game: 19981/19981 pure-core bit-exact + 19 charge-complete + 13 emit edges |
| `AsteroidFieldDamageBehaviorClass` | `0x437310` | **IN** | environmental damage |

| `HideWhenFoggedBehaviorClass` | `0x53ddc0` | **out** | render-visibility reaction to fog |

**Scope consequence:** the per-entity sim tick is **not just movement** — it is ~13 sim behaviors +
hardpoint fire-control, several with **cross-entity writes** (damage to other units, AI order
issuance, target acquisition, fog reveal). The Phase-B command buffer must therefore carry a rich
write set (damage apply, order issue, target set, fog update), not only movement. This confirms the
slice at the upper end (~180–280 fns) and re-affirms why naive parallelization was ruled out (pervasive
cross-object writes) — the rewrite's value is in the compute/apply split, and each IN behavior must be
classified Phase-A-compute vs Phase-B-apply when lifted. Census artifact: `BEHENUM` lines (the hook's
one-shot RTTI dump of `entity+0x278`); decompiled `vfunc_6` bodies in `decomp/{3c2310,633a30,53ddc0,
58bd80,4f6070,5373c0}.c`.

**Validation:** the DIFFTRACE oracle already covers movement state machine + world position
(`entity+0x78`) + hardpoint fire-control state. Each lifted function is diffed by replaying a fixed
save and comparing the per-tick DIFFTRACE hash stream bit-for-bit. Coverage gap to close in Phase 4:
fold RNG state + command-queue contents.

#### IN sim behaviors — lift log

**✅ Behavior #1 — `DamageTrackingBehaviorClass::vfunc_6` (`0x58bd80`) LIFTED 2026-06-01** →
`sim/damage_tracking.{h,cpp}` (+ `sim/tests/damage_tracking_test.cpp`, 7 host cases). First of the
13 IN behaviors, and the first to drive the channel-1 `CommandSink` seam (`command_sink.h`) with a
real behavior rather than synthetic host cases.

- **Census-label correction.** The census tagged it "HP/damage application (cross-entity)". The
  per-tick `vfunc_6` does **not** write another entity's HP — it is a **timed damage/status-effect
  decay ticker** over the entity's *own* effect list at `entity+0x1a0` (a hash-indexed intrusive
  list; nodes `{+0x10 key, +0x14 duration}`). Actual HP application happens at effect-*attach* time
  (a slot/connect path), not in the periodic update — that attach path stays to-find.
- **Per-tick algorithm:** `decay = (FUN_1403727a0 + FUN_1403725f0)·_DAT_140b168fc` (template base ×
  game-speed mode × faction × buff — world-coupled, modelled behind `DamageEnv`); walk the list,
  `duration -= decay`, remove nodes whose new duration is **not > 0** (exactly-0 removed); **on the
  empty transition** (count→0) emit **parameterless signal `0x2d`** (`kSigDamageEffectsCleared`) on
  `entity+0x38`; tail `rate(+0x0c) = (hz·accum(+0x08)) / interval(behavior+0x34)`, `accum := 0`.
- **Determinism:** no sim RNG drawn; the only cross-boundary effect is the single edge-triggered
  `0x2d` emit, which fires iff the list empties this tick — **removal-order independent**, so the
  in-engine hash list is faithfully modelled as an insertion-ordered vector. Phase-A parallel-safe
  (own `+0x1a0` sub-object) modulo that one buffered emission. `command_sink.h` gains `0x2d`.

**✅ DTDMG IN-GAME ORACLE — DECAY + RATE PASS; emit/multi-node DORMANT (2026-06-01).** Added the
`DTDMG` capture to the hook DLL (`hooks/winmm_proxy.c`, profile build, `EAW_DIFFTRACE=1`): wraps
`FUN_14058bd80`, snapshots the `+0x1a0` effect list `{key,duration}` + `count`/`accum`/`interval`
**before** the trampoline and re-walks survivors **after** (expired nodes are freed, survivors
remain), so per-node `decay = dur_before − dur_after` is recovered offline without calling the
world-coupled rate fns (`3727a0` reads a player-diplomacy table + buff stack). Trampoline runs
exactly once → no determinism perturbation; emit events bypass the latch so any empty-transition is
logged. **Two full TR space battles (~15k sim ticks), 4 clean samples — all confirm the running
math:**
  - **Per-node decay** = a single per-entity scalar, subtracted from `+0x14`, and it *varies per
    entity* (`0.35`, `0.50`, `0.60`, `0.60` — the faction/buff/game-speed composition modelled
    behind `DamageEnv`); survivor kept iff new duration `> 0` (`emit=0`).
  - **Rate readout** `rate = hz·accum/interval` with **`hz` = `(float)DAT_140b0a340` = 30 = interval**
    → `rate == accum` exactly on all 4 (residual `0.000000`), across a 10× magnitude range
    (`0.63 … 6.28`). (Confirms `DAT_140b0a340` is an **int32** cast to float, value 30.)
  - **NOT observed: the `0x2d` empty-transition (`emit=1`) and any multi-node tick.** Effect lists
    were uniformly **depth-1**; a caught effect's next behavior-tick never reappears → effects are
    **refreshed under continuous fire** and only drain to empty when a unit *stops* being hit, which
    coincides with unit death / battle-end (sim no longer ticking the behavior). Same **DTFIRE-dormant
    pattern**: the path that runs is validated; the rarely-exercised edge isn't reachable in this
    content. The `0x2d` emit is a 2-line `count→0` consequence (`58bd80` lines 63–82), covered by host
    cases `test_exactly_zero_removed` + `test_empty_transition_emits_once`; the `DTDMG` oracle stays
    **armed + committed** to confirm it opportunistically in any future capture that exercises it.

**✅ Behavior #2 — `EnergyPoolBehaviorClass::vfunc_6` (`0x56c030`) LIFTED 2026-06-01** →
`sim/energy_pool.{h,cpp}` (+ `sim/tests/energy_pool_test.cpp`, 10 host cases). The **cleanest** of the
IN behaviors so far: a **pure self-contained Phase-A regen ticker** — no sim RNG, no cross-entity
read/write, no `CommandSink` seam at all (contrast #1's `0x2d` emit). It writes only its own energy
value and one presentation flag.

- **Per-tick algorithm:** `value' = clamp(value + regen_rate·dt, 0, max_energy)` on the pool sub-object
  `(entity+0xf0)+0xf8`, where `regen_rate = template+0xddc`, `dt = FUN_140398010(entity,4)` (the
  per-tick game-speed/difficulty time-scale — same multiplier family as the locomotor/hardpoint
  lifts), `max_energy = FUN_140372320(template,entity) = base(template+0xdd0)·(1 + Σ buff modifiers)`.
  The clamp is the engine's exact two-compare form (`v<0→0; v>max→max; else v`). Float order faithful:
  compose `value+rate·dt` first, then clamp to a **separately-queried** `max`.
- **Drain gate** (only if `template+0x8b != 0`, i.e. the unit type has a drain source): look up the
  source (`DAT_140b15418` vtable`[0x220]`, keyed `entity+0x58`); source null → return `NoDrainSource`
  (`0x80650001`) with no write; drain predicate `FUN_140527520` (a `BitwiseAnd<bool>` over `src+0x198`)
  **false → force-drain** the pool to `min(max,0)=0`; **true → normal regen**. All three world-coupled
  resolutions collapse to one `DrainDisposition` enum behind `EnergyEnv`.
- **Guards:** pool present (`entity+0xf0`) + regen not disabled (`pool+0x130 == 0`) — either failing is
  a guarded no-op (`Ok`, no write, no UI flag). The in-engine `template==0` null checks are defensive
  dead paths for a real EnergyPool unit (folded into the env's resolution).
- **UI flag:** reached only after a write (`LAB_14056c180`) — if this object is the locally-selected
  one (`entity+0x50 == DAT_140a286f0`) set `entity+0x3a0 |= 1`, a presentation "refresh the stat bar"
  dirty bit, **not lockstep-relevant**.
- **Determinism:** no RNG, no other-entity access; writes only own `pool+0xf8` (+ own UI flag) → fully
  Phase-A parallel-safe with **no Phase-B command**. The three world-coupled inputs are behind
  `EnergyEnv` (`time_scale`/`max_energy`/`drain_disposition`/`regen_rate`/`local_selected`).
**✅ DTNRG IN-GAME ORACLE — REGEN + CLAMP + SHARED-`dt` PASS (2026-06-01).** Added the `DTNRG`
capture to the hook DLL (`hooks/winmm_proxy.c`, profile build, `EAW_DIFFTRACE=1`): wraps `0x56c030`,
snapshots `pool+0xf8` (+ `regen_rate` template+0xddc, base `template+0xdd0`, disabled `pool+0x130`,
drain `template+0x8b`) **before** the trampoline and re-reads `pool+0xf8` **after**, so the per-tick
delta recovers the world-coupled time-scale `dt` offline as `dt = (value'−value)/rate` (the DTDMG
technique — no need to call `FUN_140398010` ourselves). Trampoline runs exactly once → no determinism
perturbation. Two-layer sampling: one latched entity per tick (`DTNRG`) + a **latch-bypass `DTNRGINT`
stream** that logs ANY entity whose pool lands strictly inside `(0, base)` — needed because the
latched pools refill to the cap each interval (`va==base`, a one-sided `dt≥…` bound only), so the
interior landings (drain outpaced one regen step) are what pin `dt`. `tools/analyze_energy_oracle.py`.
**Result over a TR capital battle (67 latched + 58 interior samples, 7 entities, rates 400/800):**
  - **Recovered `dt` = `1.000000` exactly** (min=max=mean, stdev `0.000000`) across **all 58 interior
    samples** spanning multiple entities and regen rates → confirms the rate·`dt` model with a
    **single shared game-speed scalar** (normal speed → scale 1.0); `FUN_140398010(entity,4)` is a
    clean per-tick multiplier.
  - **Model reproduces `va` 67/67** latched samples via `va == clamp(vb + rate·dt, 0, base)` — all 67
    were upper-clamp ticks (pool refilled to the cap), so the clamp must independently produce
    `va==base` from `vb+rate·dt>base`, the genuinely non-circular check. `va` never `< 0`, never
    `> base` (no buffed pools in this capture).
  - **NOT observed: the lower clamp (`va→0`), the disabled no-op (`pool+0x130≠0`), and the drain
    branch (`template+0x8b`).** No unit ran out of energy / got ionized / triggered an energy-drain
    ability in the capture — the rare edges, same DTFIRE/DTDMG-dormant pattern. All three are
    host-covered (`test_regen_floors_at_zero`, `test_disabled_no_write`, `test_draining_zeroes_pool`);
    the `DTNRG` oracle stays **armed + committed** to confirm them opportunistically. (Note: `param_3`
    is the sim **tick** the spine passes to `vfunc_6`, not a mode flag — a harmless capture-field nit.)

**✅ Behavior #3 — `AbilityCountdownBehaviorClass::vfunc_6` (`0x42f910`) LIFTED + DTABIL ORACLE PASS
(2026-06-01)** → `sim/ability_countdown.{h,cpp}`. A self-contained **integer-tick** cooldown/chargeup
ticker over the entity's own recharge manager at `entity+0x1e8`: a fixed 0x4d-slot array {timer
`+0x8+i*4`, chargeup-target `+0x13c+i*4`, mode byte `+0x270+i` (0=countdown / !=0=chargeup)},
last-serviced tick `+0x2c0`. `delta = tick − last_tick` (integer ticks — **no game-speed float scale**,
cleaner than #2's `dt`). COUNTDOWN `timer = max(timer−delta, 0)`, and on the **edge** a cooldown
reaches 0 emits sig `0x2c` (kSigAbilityRecharged, payload `{vftable, slot}`) on `owner+0x38`, gated by
the heavy availability predicate `FUN_14039b480` (modelled behind `AbilityCountdownEnv::ability_ready`).
CHARGEUP `timer = min(timer+delta, target)`, and on reaching the target invokes `FUN_14042f460`
(env-modelled `charge_complete`) — which **recycles the slot into a cooldown**: flips mode 1→0, resets
the timer to a new (larger) cooldown value, updates the target, emits sig `0x29`, fires an SFX cue.
No sim RNG; writes only its own array + recharge stamp; Phase-A parallel-safe modulo the two buffered
emits. 8 host cases.
  **DTABIL in-game oracle** (`hooks/winmm_proxy.c`, profile, `EAW_DIFFTRACE=1`): inline trampoline on
  `0x42f910` (16-byte prologue `44 89 44 24 18 / 53 / 41 54 / 41 55 / 41 56 / 48 83 ec 48`, FF25
  abs-jmp, arg count 3 `behavior,entity,tick`); snapshots all 77 slot timers before/after, logs per
  active slot `tb/ta/mode/tgt/delta` (any-entity, latch-bypassed + capped) + a `DTABILEDGE` stream for
  cooldown→0 edges. `tools/analyze_ability_oracle.py` reproduces `ta` and splits pure-core vs the
  env-callback recycle ticks. **Result over a capital battle (25 entities, 20000 samples):**
  - **pure-core `ta` 19981/19981 bit-exact** (countdown 11154 + chargeup-below-target) — integer
    recurrence reproduces the live binary with NO scalar to recover.
  - **19 charge-complete events**, all correctly recycled (`ta != tgt`): the core's DECISION to invoke
    `charge_complete` is right; the post-tick value is the env-owned recycle write, and the cooldown
    that follows is reproduced bit-exact by the COUNTDOWN path (traced live: `…749 →[complete]→ 1350`
    then mode-0 `1350→1349→…`).
  - **13 cooldown→0 `DTABILEDGE`s**, all consistent (`tb>0 ∧ tb−delta≤0`) — confirms the sig-`0x2c`
    emit trigger fires exactly when a cooldown lands on 0. **Both cross-boundary acts (countdown emit +
    chargeup recycle) exercised in-game** — richer than #1 (whose `0x2d` stayed dormant) and #2 (whose
    drain/clamp edges stayed dormant). The `0x2c` gate (`39b480` verdict) is env-modelled, so whether a
    given edge actually emits is host-covered; the oracle validates the edge TRIGGER. Capture saved
    `logs/dtabil_oracle_pass.log` (reproducible, not committed).

#### (Original pre-Phase-2 Phase-3 list — SUPERSEDED, kept for history)
1. ~~Tick clock / scheduler — `FUN_14027c360`, `DAT_140b0a320/340`, FF gate `0x9cf314`.~~ (still valid)
2. ~~Game service / loop spine — `FUN_14028d400` (gsvc), `FUN_1403a76b0`.~~ *(`a76b0` is hardpoints,
   not the loop spine; the spine is `3639d0`/`2be640`/`3a6b80`.)*
3. ~~Per-component movement / path-follow — `FUN_140387010` → `FUN_140387400`.~~ *(this is HARDPOINT
   fire-control, not movement; the mover is `LocomotorBehaviorClass::vfunc_6`.)*
4. ~~Cross-entity write sites — `FUN_1403846c0`, `FUN_1402d5290`.~~ (still valid; now step 5 above)
5. ~~Command-queue drain / apply.~~ (still valid; now step 6 above)

### Phase 4 — Determinism surface (weeks, overlaps Phase 3) — *the hardest constraint*
Per boundary work item #4, this is what makes the rewrite *correct*, not just fast. Map exhaustively:

- Every **RNG draw** and its seeding/ordering.
- **Float-accumulation order** dependencies (the FF force-sum loop in `FUN_1403a76b0` accumulates
  across members — order-sensitive; the canonical apply order must reproduce it).
- **Save/load + replay + lockstep-MP** serialization paths — the divergence detectors.
  Output: a determinism test gate (replay a long battle; assert bit-identical end-state) that the
  parallel rewrite must pass. **Without this gate the rewrite is unverifiable.**

### Phase 5 — Full-breadth long tail (optional, person-years)
Only if a true standalone source build (not the threading retrofit) is ever wanted: renderer (D3D9),
audio (MSS), UI, networking, Bink, the remaining ~20,000 functions. **Out of scope for the rewrite**;
listed only to bound Product 2 honestly. Recommendation: do not pursue unless the goal changes.

---

## 3. What this buys, and the realistic cost

| | Critical-path slice (Product 1) | Full recompilable decomp (Product 2) |
|---|---|---|
| Functions | hundreds (sim core) | 21,744 |
| Unblocks sim-parallel rewrite | **Yes** | Yes (overkill) |
| Effort (solo, w/ good RTTI/string recovery) | **months** | **person-decade — not realistic solo** |
| Validation | differential vs live binary | matching/recompile |
| Recommendation | **the actual goal** | only if scope changes |

The rewrite payoff is already quantified (boundary scope): a correct compute→apply parallel sim
yields **~3–4× faster fast-forward** (Amdahl, s≈0.15, N=4→2.9×, N=8→4×). The decomp is the
*enabling cost* for that one bounded win.

---

## 4. Risks / kill criteria

- **Poor RTTI/string recovery (Phase-0 gate fails).** If <~40% of sim-reachable functions auto-name,
  manual effort balloons — re-scope to the gsvc Phase-A body only, or stop.
- **Optimizer-fused functions.** MSVC inlining/ICF merges logic across the source's original
  boundaries; some functions won't cleanly map to re-implementable units. Mitigation: re-implement by
  *behavior* (validated by the oracle), not by matching.
- **Determinism rabbit hole (Phase 4).** This is open-ended and is the true long pole. If the
  determinism gate can't be made green, the parallel rewrite is unsafe regardless of decomp progress
  — so Phase 4 risk is really *rewrite* risk surfaced early. Front-load it.
- **Hidden coupling.** Sim functions may reach into render/UI/script state we assumed out-of-slice,
  pulling scope creep. Mitigation: the differential harness catches missing dependencies as checksum
  drift the moment a lifted function is wired in.

## 5. Recommended next concrete step

Phases 0–2 done; Phase 3 scoped **and its gate task (behavior census) complete** — the in-slice set
is the 13 sim behaviors + locomotor + hardpoint fire-control + spine tabulated above (~180–280 fns).
**Units 1 (tick clock), 2 (entity-update spine), 3 (locomotor — Starship skeleton + model +
accel→velocity integrator) are LIFTED** (`sim/`, host-validated via `just sim-test`, 33 checks).
Concrete continuations, any order:
(a) **close the in-game differential loop** — read the 4 locomotor constants (`DAT_1408007dc/d4/f4`,
`DAT_1408754bc`) from the binary (one Ghidra/objdump pass), then replay a fixed save and diff the
lifted integrator's `entity+0x78` output vs the live DIFFTRACE `DTPOS` stream — the **first true
oracle check** and the highest-value validation milestone;
(b) **finish unit 3's steering bodies** — lift accelerate `622b80` + turn `622e90` (set
`accel_factor`/`steer_blend`/heading from the destination + template) and the Walk `0x61e930`
variant, replacing those `LocomotorEnv` callouts;
(c) **unit 4 — hardpoint fire-control** (`a76b0`/`387010`/`387400` …) to broaden the slice.
Recommended: (a) — it converts host-validated lifts into an oracle-validated integrator and
exercises the differential-test methodology end-to-end for the first time. Two
front-loads: (a) the determinism pins (Phase 4) — the `a76b0` order-sensitive float sum + RNG draws —
since they are *rewrite* risk surfaced early; (b) classify each IN behavior's writes as Phase-A
(own-entity, parallel) vs Phase-B (cross-entity, deferred-command) as it is lifted, since that split
*is* the rewrite. Before heavy lifting, apply the recovered struct layouts as Ghidra types so the
decompiles read as `entity->position`/`entity->behaviors[i]` rather than raw offsets.
